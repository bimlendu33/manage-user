# manage-user
This is a sample project in angular to manage a list of users with CRUD operations as admin.
1) I have tried to keep responsive as much as possisble.
2) A simple login is there, pelase use username as 'bimkumar' & password as 'admin123'.
3) login is not very vast(like base64 or JWT), bcz of less time given just added casual login page.
4) Have added all features as per document, just could not approach Avatar bcz of less time allocated.
5) Adding logic for Avatar, simply adding avatar in blob format and then adding path to it, would work for avatar also.
6) Please do npm install at package.json location with a global @angular/cli installed system.



#tried my best to make it feasible. Hope you like this small proj :)
